# ImSig
ImSig is an immune gene signature that can be used to deconvolute blood and tissue transcriptomic data to identify the different immune cells present in its samples.

Use these R scripts if you are deconvoluting a blood or tissue derived transcriptomic data. 
Pdata file is required for these scripts to work.
Please refer the wiki page for the entire workflow.
